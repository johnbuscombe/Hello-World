# Hello-World
My name is John, and I am undertaking a small arduino project currently, revolving around a CNC machine. I enjoy coding, although I am not advanced, but hope to learn through this website and my continuing projects etc. Unlike Hubot (the assistant on the Hello world page) I have not had tacos from the moon, or even the earth. So I cannot compare them!!!!
